# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

**_Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?_**

For this project, I created an intelligentagent to solve a pathfinding problem where the AI, a pirate, needs to find the treasure in a maze. I was provided with the python files to setup the environment as well as store episodes for exploration. The code I added to create the agent was the loop for navigating the environment and what should happen depending on what the agent does. 

**_What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?_**
Computer scientists use technology to solve a problem. This could be a range of different issues and solutions. It matters because it benefits society as a whole when we have the technology to solve major issues and make like easier for us all. Because of them, we have faster communication, automation, health solutions, and more.

**_How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?_**
The way I like to approach a problem as a computer scientist is to break it down step by step. After figuring out what needs to be incorporated in the project, the next thing I like to do is figure out the requirements and how to implement them. Then, I work through each element, coding and testing them along the way until I get to the finished program.

**_What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?_**
I think my ethical responsibilites to the end user and organization is to make sure I am producing safe and secure code. Both are looking to people in my position to keep their information safe and it's crucial that we don't give easy access to attackers. The other thing I learned more from this course is to make sure hidden biases and opinions aren't entering my code and that I step back and make sure the code is as fair as possible.
